        <div class="faq-content">
          <p> Supahands is a business outsourcing platform powered by a team of SupaAgents. Supahands was built to help entrepreneurs and companies scale faster by taking care of their tedious and repetitive business tasks and projects.

        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>We have Supahands Entrepreneur and Supahands Business. Under Supahands Entrepreneur, we have the Starter, Growth, and Pro plan, which you can view here. Supahands Entrepreneur is a self-service platform that suits small teams or individual entrepreneurs as you manage your own projects and speak directly to the SupaAgent. Meanwhile, Supahands Business is for larger, long-term projects that require the special attention of our Project Managers.</p>

        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Most definitely! We pay a lot of attention in ensuring that we provide a service that our SupaUsers feel safe using.
  
            All personal data is stored securely on our server. Besides that, our SupaAgents do not have the access to personal confidential data and have all signed Non-Disclosure Agreements before they join the team. Additionally, when a task is picked up by a SupaAgent, all communication and work will only be viewable and accessible by our Project Managers for quality control purposes.

            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>A ‘Hand’ is the currency we use here at Supahands. Each ‘Hand’ is worth up to 20 minutes of work. How many ‘Hands’ it takes for us to complete a task would depend on the nature of your task, such as how big it is or how
                    difficult it is to obtain the information you're looking for.

            <h5 class="trigger" href="#0">How do I send in a task?</h5>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Once you’ve signed up, click on “New task” button that is located on the top left corner of your screen and tell us what you would like help with. Be as detailed as possible; as it’ll help our SupaAgents understand your
                    needs and respond to you better.
                    <br><br> Once your task is picked up by a SupaAgent, you will be informed and 1 ‘Hand’ will automatically be deducted from your account. Have a look at the type of tasks that we could help you with here (link to entrepreneur
                    page). If you have a large task that can be broken down into small independent parts, you can break it down and send them in separately so that several SupaAgents can work on them simultaneously - completing your task
                    faster.
                    <br><br> Our SupaAgents will work your task with 1 ‘Hand’ (20 minutes) first and will get back to you with an update on what they have covered. If the task requires more time to complete, the SupaAgent will notify you
                    via your task thread with how many additional Hands she/he will need to see the task through. You can then provide your SupaAgent with further instructions or feedback before they proceed.

            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>We have a 24-hour turnaround time for 1 ‘Hand’. So, our SupaAgents are expected to complete at least 1 ‘Hand’ on your task within 24 hours. Depending on their individual availabilities, they may be able to complete more
                    ‘Hands’. Remember, the more detail you include in your task submission, the easier it will be for the SupaAgent to start working on it.
                    <br><br> Do you think your task looks like it could use a few people to work on it at the same time? Break it down and submit multiple tasks for several SupaAgents to work on your task simultaneously.

                <p>Our aim is to give you the best quality service. If you are not satisfied with the work, please let us know. If it is an error on our part, we will rework it for you at no additional charge.
                    <br><br> Our turnaround time for work requests is 24 hours per Hand, during business days. For tasks that require more time, we will inform you of the approximate number of Hands or workdays required.

                <p>Unfortunately, we do not allow refund of Hands that have already been deducted. However, if you are not satisfied with the work, do let us know immediately. In case there is an an error on our part, we will rework the task
                    for you at no additional charge.

                <p>Yes, you can. Just write a message on your task thread informing the SupaAgent that you would like to cancel the task. If the SupaAgent has not started working on it, but 1 ‘Hand’ has been automatically deducted after it
                    was picked up, let us know. We will provide a voucher code for you to redeem the ‘Hand’.

            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>We sure can! SupaAgents will prioritise urgent tasks and work on those first. Just indicate on the task title that your task is Urgent, provide a due date and time for our SupaAgents and they will try their best to finish
                    the task within the deadline.
                    <br><br> For urgent tasks, we charge double the amount of Hands needed, e.g. if a task takes 4 ‘Hands’ to complete, we will take 8 ‘Hands’ to work on it urgently. Whether a SupaAgent is able to work on it during the
                    weekend is subjected to their individual availabilities so make sure to ask!
